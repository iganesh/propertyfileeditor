Property File Editor - Spring Boot Application
Overview:
The Property File Editor is a web-based application built using Spring Boot that allows users to manage configuration properties stored in a local .properties file. It provides a user-friendly interface to load, view, and update property key-value pairs dynamically, with real-time feedback on successful updates.
Key Features:  
Dynamic File Selection:  
Users can specify the full path to a .properties file on the local file system via an initial file selection page.  

The application creates the file if it doesn’t exist, ensuring seamless operation.

Property Management Interface:  
Displays all properties from the selected file in a tabular format with columns for Key, Value, Action, and Status.  

Values are presented in editable input fields that become active on click, maintaining a clean and intuitive UI.

Real-Time Updates:  
An "Update" button in the Action column allows users to modify property values.  

Upon clicking, the updated value is saved to the properties file, and a "Success" message appears in the Status column for the modified row.

Feedback Mechanism:  
Successful updates are visually confirmed with a green "Success" message in the Status column, providing immediate user feedback.  

The status is temporary, clearing on page refresh or subsequent updates for a streamlined experience.

Technical Details:  
Framework: Spring Boot 3.2.4 with Thymeleaf for server-side rendering.  

Dependencies: Spring Web for RESTful endpoints, Thymeleaf for templating, and Maven for build management.  

Frontend: HTML with embedded JavaScript for dynamic form handling and CSS for styling.  

Backend: Java-based service layer to read from and write to the properties file using the Properties class.  

Architecture:  
Controller: Handles file selection, property loading, and updates, passing data to the view layer.  

Service: Manages file I/O operations and property manipulation.  

Views: Two templates—file-selection.html for file input and index.html for property management.

Usage:  
Launch the application via mvn spring-boot:run.  

Access it at http://localhost:8080.  

Enter the path to a .properties file (e.g., C:/temp/config.properties).  

View and edit properties in the table, with updates reflected in the file instantly.

Potential Enhancements:  
Add error handling for file access issues or invalid inputs.  

Implement persistent status messages or a history of updates.  

Enhance security with authentication and CSRF protection for production use.  

Improve UX with loading indicators or advanced styling.

Purpose:
Designed as a lightweight tool for developers and administrators to manage configuration files without manual editing, this application combines simplicity with functionality, making property management efficient and accessible through a web interface.
